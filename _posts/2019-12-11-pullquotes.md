Volunteer members of the FLUXNET Outreach Working Group first brainstormed the idea for a podcast in May, 2023. Our little group of flux scientists wanted to share the opportunities and challenges associated with flux science to stakeholders, researchers searching for inspiration, and curious minds in the general public. In true scientific fashion, countless hours were spent exploring every aspect of what this podcast would involve. We asked questions about the perfect format, target audience, ideal outcomes, individual roles, expected timelines, budgets, and the characteristics of story-worthy topics. After months of deliberation, Meet the Fluxers was born.{% include pullquote.html quote="Our podcast mission is to bridge the gap between flux scientists and stakeholders." %}

One year into planning and steps away from recording our first episode, we still don't have all the answers, but perhaps we have found our purpose. Our ambition with this project is to highlight how stakeholders are engaging with flux science; educate listeners on how this work is communicated and conceptualized; and build non-technical working language around these topics. Meet the Fluxers is especially eager to connect with community leaders; policymakers and funding agencies; early career researchers; and people from diverse political and social backgrounds.

The podcast is uniquely defined by its rotating cast of co-hosts, flux experts, and stakeholders. Not only does this encourage more widespread involvement from the flux community, but also, it guides listeners towards an unbiased understanding of flux science as it pertains to the real world. Meet the Fluxers embraces diverse perspectives from listeners and guests, while rejecting coded language.
