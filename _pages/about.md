Meet the Fluxers is a podcast developed by the FLUXNET Outreach Working Group bridging the gap between eddy covariance flux scientists & stakeholders. Our audience and participants are researchers and stakeholders interested in applying flux science for societal benefits.

We aim to collaborate on telling stories and insights of all Fluxers in and outside academia and hope to explore the full breadth, depth and diversity of flux science around the globe. 

We are approaching our podcast as a co-learning experience for hosts, participants and all listeners.
